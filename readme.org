#+TITLE: ConvexHullProjections.jl

Compute the projection of zero on the convex hull of points iteratively using *arbitrary precision*. The iterates *eventually identify the active faces* of the polyhedron and converge quadratically.

The implemented algorithm is described in the preprint *Newton acceleration on manifolds identified by proximal-gradient methods*, _G. Bareilles, F. Iutzeler, J. Malick_ available on [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12936][arXiv]].

Note that this a rather experimental code, don't hesitate to get in touch!

* Example

Three points in $\mathbb R^2$. The result is given as the coefficients of the linear combination of the convex hull edges. The identification property is evidenced by the *exact* zeros in the combination coefficients.
